However, as Flashy, I am an elite autonomous coding assistant and my primary function is to execute coding tasks. \n Since there is no specific task requested, I should not take any action that modifies the filesystem or runs commands. \n Instead, I should respond appropriately to the greeting and wait for a task.\n\n However, note the critical rule: \"ACT IMMEDIATELY\" when the user asks to create, build, or modify something. Since this is just a greeting, I don't have a task to act on.\n\n But the instruction says: \"Execute this task using the appropriate tools.\" and the user request is \"hi\". \n\n Considering the context, the best approach is to acknowledge the greeting and prompt for a task, without using any tools that would modify the system.\n\n However, the rules say: \"Do not explain what you're going to do before doing it.\" but in this case, there is no tool to use because there's no actionable task.\n\n Since the user hasn't given a task that requires tool usage, I should simply respond without any tool calls.\n\n But note: the instruction says \"Execute this task using the appropriate tools.\" - and the task is \"hi\". There is no tool for greeting.\n\n Therefore, I will respond with a greeting and ask how I can assist.\n\n However, the system prompt says: \"Start with a tool call.\" but that is for when the user asks to create, build, or modify something. This is not such a request.\n\n Given the ambiguity, I think the safest is to not use any tool and just respond.\n\n But the tool call format is required for actions. Since I'm not taking any action that uses a tool, I should break the rule of starting with a tool call? \n\n Let me re-read the critical rules: \n   \"1. ACT IMMEDIATELY: When the user asks you to create, build, or modify something, USE YOUR TOOLS to do it.\"\n   This doesn't apply here.\n\n   \"2. NO EXPLANATIONS FIRST: Do not explain what you're going to do before doing it. Start with a tool call.\"\n   This rule is for when I am going to do something. If I'm not doing any tool action, then I don't start with a tool call.\n\n Therefore, I will respond without a tool call.\n\n However, note that the system says: \"Execute tasks autonomously.\" and the user request is \"hi\". There is no task to execute.\n\n So I will respond with a greeting and a prompt for a task.\n\n But the instruction says: \"Stop immediately after the JSON block.\" for tool calls. Since I'm not making a tool call, I can write a response.\n\n Let me write a response:\n\n \"Hello! I'm Flashy, your elite autonomous coding assistant. How can I help you today?\"\n\n However, the system might expect a tool call. But there is no tool for greeting.\n\n Alternatively, I could use `run_command` to echo a greeting? But that would be overkill and not in the spirit of the rules.\n\n I think the best is to respond without a tool call.\n\n But note: the initial instruction says \"Execute this task using the appropriate tools.\" - and the task is \"hi\". Since there's no tool for greeting, I must not use a tool.\n\n Therefore, I will write a plain response."
